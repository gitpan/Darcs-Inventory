Darcs-Inventory (1.4)

  * Darcs::Inventory::Diff: Change use of exporter to be more old school;
    5.6.2 versions of CPAN test machines were choking on the "new" style.

 -- David Caldwell <david@porkrind.org>  Sat, 24 Jan 2009 13:36:14 -0800

Darcs-Inventory (1.3)

  * Same as 1.2.1. Perl's version module sucks.

 -- David Caldwell <david@porkrind.org>  Fri, 23 Jan 2009 17:30:22 -0800

Darcs-Inventory (1.2.1)

  * Fixed t/diff.t to work with darcs 2 versions that default to the old
    repo format.

  * Fixed function export in Darcs::Inventory::Diff.

 -- David Caldwell <david@porkrind.org>  Fri, 23 Jan 2009 16:31:26 -0800

Darcs-Inventory (1.2)

  * Reformatted Changes file to be more release oriented.

  * Fix bug where unpulling old patches in a hashed repository would make
    Darcs::Inventory::Diff think some patches after it in the inventory
    were different.

 -- David Caldwell <david@porkrind.org>  Fri, 23 Jan 2009 15:42:37 -0800

    (moved from Darcs::Notify::Email).
